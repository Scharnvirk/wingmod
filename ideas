* sprite sheet in shaders

* autoperfer

* render map shadow once (...somehow?)

* pausing game

* material config (could be applied as an extension to JSON loader which based on given config would skip specular and other expensive textures...)

* rotation of particles? but how given they're always face-up to the camera...?
